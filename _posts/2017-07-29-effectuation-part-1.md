"How to be Innovative, Hm..."

Cheesy title isn’t it? Most posts who have the word ‘innovation’ or ‘innovative culture’ in their title, are normative. It filled with suggestions like “we need to support a good idea from everyone—including employee”, or “we must think out of the box”, or “innovate or die”.

My response is usually “Hey, I already know that! Show me the real way to that!”. I hate that kind of post, with the same reason I hate 97,5% of what politicians say. Hopefully, this series of posts would be different, would give clear & concrete idea on how to be innovative.

Randomly surfing in the sea of blogs with startup topic, I found a new interesting mindset called ‘Effectual Reasoning’ of ‘Effectuation’. At first, I was hoping to see new concept which build by entrepreneur like ‘Lean Startup’, turned out, it is a product of an academic named Saras Sarasvathy. She wanted to answer a big question: “What Makes Entrepreneurs Entrepreneurial?”

For me, Effectuation explains the fundamental difference between businessman and entrepreneur. It also separates a dreamy entrepreneur with the realistic one. As a mindset, ‘Effectual Reasoning’ can be a core for innovative culture. So, it’s a must-read if you want to build an entrepreneurial organization. And of course, if you want to be a great entreprenuer/innovator. What is it exactly?

## What is Effectuation?

### Let's start with 'What is _not_ effectuation?'

One of the easiest ways to explain a new concept, is to start by the related-but-familiar concept. For this case, it’s causal reasoning. First time to hear it? Trust me, you know about it.

Causal reasoning begins with a predetermined clear goal and some means (read: conditions) that might be the cause(s) of the goal. Then, it ends by choosing what causal means needed to be fulfilled to achieve the goal.

The goal exists from the beginning. It’s standby still and only one. The means themselves—most of the times—are obvious to all. Because we can have more than one set of means to achieve the goal, the reasoning is on the choosing of the best set.

Sounds familiar? Of course. Causal reasoning is the way we did school problem sets. Since we were kids, we’ve been bombarded with this way of reasoning. There is always a best-expected answer from the teacher.

Even more, MBA programs all across the world are still teaching a lot of causal reasonings to their students. Here’s an example:

Goal : setting-up a successful donut franchise business.

Means : market, secret recipe, hiring, production system, franchise contract, brand, legal, supply-chain, etc.

The goal on causal thinking might be distributed to other smaller goals—like defining the brand or setting up accounting book, etc. However, in solving those smaller goals, the reasoning way is still causal.

We can see this reasoning as 'managerial thinking'.


### So we couldn't be creative while doing causal reasoning?

Yes we can. Saras called that 'creative causal reasoning' or 'strategic thinking'.


Let me give a concrete example:

"Okay, now I need to setup my donut franchise business. Wait, wait, I remember my friend who let his other friend to use his company's legal entity. Maybe he will let me use it too. I'm okay if he ask certain small fee. In this first setup phase, the less things I need to handle the better."

But it's still not an effectual reasoning.

### Finally, what is effectual reasoning?


The core mantra of effectual reasoning is "These are what I have: this is who I am; these are what I know; these are who I know. Therefore, what are the best possible ends I can have by utilizing them?”

You might notice it. Saras, in Effectual reasoning, doesn’t use the word ‘goal’, instead she uses ‘end’. Why?

An entrepreneur with effectual reasoning, will not tie their early phase of a venture with an ambitious goal—or even a simple goal. Well, a lot of them are obviously smart people, they might have the ability to imagine that ambitious goal. But they don’t focus themselves on that.

Because when an imaginary end they chose became reality, they know they’ll find new means anyway---which implies to new imaginary ends (read: new directions to move).

Because the new ends in one time might be very radically different to each other & also they evolve over time, they know, having a fixed and clear goal is useless.

That's why, the word ‘end’ suits better than 'goal'.

Am I too complicated?

In my experience, it’d be easier to understand the iterative and experimental nature of Effectuation. I think I need a concrete story to show it better. Which is should be long enough to let the reader grasp the idea, but short enough to be fitted into a post.

Everybody loves story, my dear readers included. So, here is the next post of this series.
